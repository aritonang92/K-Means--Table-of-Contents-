# K-Means Clustering-Table-of-Contents-
In this repository I try to explain the basic concept of K-Means Clustering using the periodic table data of elements.
In simple terms I grouped the solid elements and look at the relationship of some of their features such as melting point, first ionization energy, and its atomic radius.
This repository will continue to grow along with my findings and analysis and any comments or feedbacks from the readers are accepted.
